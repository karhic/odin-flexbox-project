My solution to [this assignment of The Odin Project] (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)

The assignment is to recreate the following image in HTML and CSS flexbox from scratch.

The assignment mentions that the goal is not to be pixel perfect or to worry about mobile screens.
Likewise it looks less than ideal on very large screens.
I'm not totally satisfied that choices in structuring things, naming things, or using certain techniques is optimal here,
but I think it looks pretty good on my laptop, and I've decided to move on now and learn more about grid and media queries and whatever else when the time is right.
